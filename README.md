Point of View (Target User): A __Freshman__ needs an __easy & convenient__ way to find __quality information__ on the existing clubs of KAIST because not all of them have __seniors to seek information from__, and all the information are __dispersed__ across different platforms (making it hard for direct comparisons).

Supported Tasks:
1. Choose a __category__ of your choice and select a club that you like based on its provided information.

2. __Inspect__ the suggested clubs and __add__ a club that interests you.

3. See if any of the __club schedules overlap__ with your school schedule. __Remove__ clubs that conflict with your other schedules.
